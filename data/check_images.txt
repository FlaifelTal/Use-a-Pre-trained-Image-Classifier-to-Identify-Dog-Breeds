Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

####

### all the answers will be based on teh results i had with with original data 

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models should correctly classifiey the breed of dog (golden retriever)

After Edit: All 3 classifieres classified the dog breed in Dog_01.jpg correctly -> golden_retriever

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: most likely no not all classified the breed of dog correctly, vgg has the highest chance of correctly classifying it followed by ResNet and lastly AlexNet

After Edit:  both vgg and resnet were able to correctly classify the dog breed in the seconed image golden_retriever_02, the same as the classification in the first image golden_retriever_01, but alexnet was noot able to correctly classify the dog breed in the second image golden_retriever_02 as in the first image golden_retriever_01 whichin the first was
classified as golden retriever the second as cocker spaniel, english cocker spaniel, cocker.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: both Vgg and AlexNet shold properly classify it as not a dog, and ResNet has a slightly lower chance of doing it while its still considered high 
 
After Edit: all three models were able to correctly classify the Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs. 

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: the best model architecture is VGG; it has the highest accuracy and performance in classifying the dog, the breed, and labels among all 3 models. 

After Edit: both vgg and resnet did an excellent job in classifying the data, while resnet took less time to classify which puts it as the first option.
